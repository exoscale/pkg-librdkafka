Upstream tarballs
=================

Since 0.9.5 the upstream tarball includes the lz4 library which is already
packaged in Debian main (lz4). librdkafka does not build against the embedded
library but instead it uses the proper liblz4-dev package. Since lz4 is DFSG
compliant we prefer to use the upstream release tarball as-is.
